## Solved Bugs

When deploying the application to heroku there were multiple bugs that arose.

Almost all of them were made by me that was typos.

There was some bugs that arose that i had to solve, but turns out i made wrong model querys.

## Remaining Bugs

- There are no known bugs remaining.

# Validator Testing

The code is ran through ESlinter and no errors occur.

There is one warning that i have chosen to leave. Or else when trying to fix this the page got stuck in an infinte loop, and fired API requests hundreds of times.

"WARNING in [eslint]\
src/pages/todo/TodosPage.js\
  Line 63:8:  React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'searchFields'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. You can also do a functional update 'setSearchFields(s => ...)' if you only need 'searchFields' in the 'setSearchFields' call  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps"Â¨

# Libraries used
- React bootstrap 
- Infinite scroll - This is used to automaticly fetch new todos as the user has reached/is nearing end of the page.

I was looking out for a datepicker as i had trouble figuring out how to implement the date picker from bootstrap. so i looked in to [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datepicker) library. But then it struck me, and i figured out how to implement it with bootstrap.

I realise now after the site is almost done that i could have checked for more packages at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)

# Deployment

To deploy the project to heroku, do the following

1. Create a app in heroku.
2. If your site is on Github, in the Heroku app go in to "Deploy" and connect your github account and project.
Lastly scroll down and click on "Deploy Branch" and make sure "main" is selected.

# UX design work

The design were made with simpicity in mind. I designed this wireframes on [creatly](app.creately.com) to have a get a visual on my vision i had in mind.
